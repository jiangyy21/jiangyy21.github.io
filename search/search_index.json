It\u2019s an iPad App built upon SwiftUI framework and Tencent ASR API. The primary user group is Chinese podcasters, who have to spend tons of hours on audio editing using traditional DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). Outcome Audioc was built within three months during the 2022 Mobile Application Innovation Contest held by Zhejiang University and Apple, and won the national second prize . We launched the alpha version on TestFlight for internal test and will launch the beta version to the public when we are ready. Background \u00b6 Podcast, the combination of \u201ciPod\u201d and \u201cbroadcast\u201d, is a type of audio content that expresses personal knowledge, thinking, and value. Chinese podcast market is growing fast during the pandemic. Podcast creation is increasing significantly. According to MoonFM, 7458 new Chinese podcasts were born in 2020, more than the sum of the previous five years. Podcast growing potential is huge. According to ListenNotes, there are 46,000 Chinese podcasts, compared to the 1.73 million in the mature English podcast market. * It means the Chinese podcast market is still in its early stages and has much growth potential. Podcasting is easy to start with but time-consuming to carry on. Anyone can be a podcaster if they are willing to express themselves, but only some have the ability to express themselves well. For many people, filler words, gaps, and repetitive expressions occur inadvertently in speech. These factors affect the listener experience, but removing them requires repetitive and time-consuming work. According to our user research, editing typically took 3-4 times longer than the original audio. With the help of speech recognition techniques, audio can be quickly recognized and batch-processed through text. There are several excellent text-audio editors, such as Descript and Spotify Soundtrap, but none of them are supporting Chinese. Solution \u00b6 To use Audioc, you only need to follow the three steps: set up, edit and export. Set up Create a project. It is a folder to store relevant audio files and their copies. Import original audio files Transcribe the audio files Copy editable files from original files Edit Text Editor. After transcribing, the text will connect to audio at the word level. Users can manipulate the audio using text editor features, such as delete, cut, copy, and past. More importantly, we support finding and deleting all in one click to remove all filler words. Track Editor. Although the text editor can boost efficiency, it sometimes needs more precision. That\u2019s why we build the track editor similar to traditional DAW to provide more flexibility but only keep the necessary features for simplicity. Specifically, we have a select/cut switch, and take advantage of iPad gestures such as click, drag, magnification, and swipe. Plus, users can combine several tracks into a multi-track editor simply by dragging and dropping. Export Currently, we provide two ways to export audio: one is to export it as a local file, and the other is to share it with other Apps. The supported formats are m4a and mp3.

It\u2019s a semester project of COMS 4170 User Interface Design taught by prof. Brain A. Smith in Columbia University. We went through several loops of design - prototype - evaluation to build a demo with usefulness and usability. Solution \u00b6 Meal Pals is an App for Columbia students to explore, join, publish, organize, and communicate their meals with other Columbia students. Explore = Home Page. Users can find a meal via search or recommendation. Join = Event Detail Page. Users can check, join and cancel an event. Publish = Post Page. Users can create an event for a restaurant. Organize = Profile Page. Users can find all events they have already posted, joined and saved. They can also edit their profile and preferences. Communicate = Notification Page. Users can accept/reject and chat with other users. Design Process \u00b6 The idea of Meal Pals came after brainstorming among 60 ideas. After that, we went through many loops of design, prototype and evaluation, keeping in mind two rules: make every loop count by testing the biggest risks, and loop as fast as possible . Needfinding \u00b6 Biggest Risks: Whether people are comfortable dining out with strangers, and how can we get into their current flow? Actions: We did the contextual inquiry on two users. It\u2019s a mix of interviewing and observing users in their actual work environment. Insights: Safety concern is the bottom line of dining out with strangers, so we restrict users to CU students Exploring new food and restaurants is not an urgent thing, leaving a room for asynchronous matching People want to find common interests in advance to avoid awkward situations, and it\u2019s more comfortable going with a group of people rather than 1-on-1 Lo-Fi prototype \u00b6 Biggest Risks : How can we design a flow that help users to explore, join, post, organize, and communicate their meals with others? Actions : We drew the Lo-fi prototype using Balsamiq, a fast and collaborative wireframing tool. Then, we prepared a list of tasks for users to perform and used a questionnaire to pre-screen volunteers. Finally, we ran two user tests and took note of their behaviors. Insights : It not only helped to gauge the effectiveness of our current solution but also let us realize some DKDK (you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know) problems. For example, we previously thought the profile page was an obvious place to store events relevant to the users. However, some users hesitated and wandered around several pages before reaching the profile page. One of the reasons could be different mappings of our App in the user\u2019s mind: functional or social? Typically, the profile page for functional Apps is used for settings, while social Apps usually display users\u2019 activities. Hi-Fi prototype \u00b6 Biggest Risks : How can we better guide users toward their goals? Actions : We improved the Lo-Fi in two ways. The first is increasing attractiveness. We added more \u201cpeople\u201d and \u201csocial\u201d elements on the home page to make our App looks more friendly. The second is reducing barriers. Regarding information design methods, we reorganized the visual hierarchy and grouping on every page. As for evaluation, we conducted a user study as usual, but this time we only gave the user a context and the mockup, and see how well they could reach their goal. Implementation \u00b6 Parallel with Hi-Fi Prototype, we coded Meal Pals using React and the Material UI component library. Go to our GitHub repository for details. Takeaway \u00b6 1. UI Design = Engineering Usefulness & Usability UI design is the process of making computer system useful and usable to people Usefulness is defined by users. You should observe the context and stand in your real user\u2019s shoes Nelson\u2019s 10 usability heuristics is a good reference for usability. 2. Tips for creating Lo-fi prototype Any tools work as long as it\u2019s low-cost. Paper is a common tool, but if you have an existing design system, it\u2019s also a good choice. It can be simple, but it should be consistent to avoid confusing your team and users. stay with the Lo-Fi prototype as long as possible because it\u2019s easy to throw away. 3. Tips for evaluation Multiple alternatives generate better feedback because people offer more criticism by comparing. Apply UCD (user-centered design) to user study. Get their consent before the test, ask them to think aloud during the test, and give them feedback. 4. Principles of Visual Information Design Information display should guide users toward goals. leave scents and only include what is needed. Visual hierarchy should reflect the goal and relative importance. Group similar information into chunks via proximity, similarity, enclosure, etc. Ensure different chunks for a clear hierarchy via size, position, negative space, images, and color. 5. How to build trust within App Think you are the App. What would you do manually to make the matching happen? Study similar products, such as marketplaces like Airbnb, about how they change over time and why.
