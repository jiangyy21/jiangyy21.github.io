It\u2019s an iPad App built upon SwiftUI framework and Tencent ASR API. * The main user group is Chinese podcasters, who have to spend tons of hours on audio editing using traditional DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). Outcome * Audioc was built within three months during 2022 Mobile Application Innovation Contest held by Zhejiang University and Apple, and won the national second prize. * We launched the alpha version on TestFlight for internal testing, and will launch beta version to public when we are ready. Background \u00b6 Podcast, the combination of \u201ciPod\u201d and \u201cbroadcast\u201d, is a type of audio content that expresses personal knowledge, thinking and value. Chinese podcast market is growing fast under pandemic. * Podcast creation is increasing significantly. According to MoonFM, 7,458 new Chinese podcasts born in 2020, more than the sum of previous five years. * Podcast growing potential is huge. According to ListenNotes, there are 46,000 Chinese podcasts, compared to the 1.73 million in the mature English podcast market. It means Chinese podcast market is still in its early stages and has a lot of potential for growth. Podcasting is easy to start with but time-consuming to carry on. * Anyone can be a podcaster if they are willing to express themselves, but not everyone has the ability to express well. For many people, filler words, gaps and repetitive expressions occur inadvertently in speech. These factors affect the listener experience, but removing them need lots of repetitive and time-consuming work. According to our user research, it typically took 3-4 times longer than original audio to edit. * With the help of speech recognition technique, audio can be quickly recognized and batch processed through text. There are several excellent text-audio editors, such as Descript and Spotify Soundtrap, but none of them support Chinese. Solution \u00b6 To use Audioc for audio editing, users only need to do the following 3 steps: set up, edit and export. * Set up * Create a project. It is a folder to store relevant audio files and their copies. * Import original audio files * Transcribe the audio files * Copy editable files from original files * Edit * Text Editor. After transcribing, the audio will be connected with text in word-level. User can manipulate the audio using text editor features, such as delete, cut, copy, and past. More importantly, we support find & delete all in one click to remove all filler words. * Track Editor. Although text editor boosts efficiency, there are still details needed to . That\u2019s why we build track editor similar to traditional DAW to provide more flexibility, but only keep necessary features for simplicity. Specifically, we have select/cut switch, and take advantage of iPad gestures such as click, drag, magnification, and swipe. Plus, users can combine several tracks to multi track editor simply by drag and drop. * Export * Currently, we provide 2 ways to export audio: one is export to local file, the other is share to other Apps. The supported formats are m4a and mp3. Check our Figma for all pages in detail. Team \u00b6 Yiyi Jiang (leader): Master student in Management Science and Engineering at Tsinghua University.
