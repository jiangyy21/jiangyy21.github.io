It\u2019s an iPad App built upon SwiftUI framework and Tencent ASR API. The primary user group is Chinese podcasters, who have to spend tons of hours on audio editing using traditional DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). Outcome - Audioc was built within three months during the 2022 Mobile Application Innovation Contest held by Zhejiang University and Apple, and won the national second prize . - We launched the alpha version on TestFlight for internal test and will launch the beta version to the public when we are ready. Video Background \u00b6 Podcast, the combination of \u201ciPod\u201d and \u201cbroadcast\u201d, is a type of audio content that expresses personal knowledge, thinking, and value. Chinese podcast market is growing fast during the pandemic. Podcast creation is increasing significantly. According to MoonFM, 7458 new Chinese podcasts were born in 2020, more than the sum of the previous five years. Podcast growing potential is huge. According to ListenNotes, there are 46,000 Chinese podcasts, compared to the 1.73 million in the mature English podcast market. * It means the Chinese podcast market is still in its early stages and has much growth potential. Podcasting is easy to start with but time-consuming to carry on. Anyone can be a podcaster if they are willing to express themselves, but only some have the ability to express themselves well. For many people, filler words, gaps, and repetitive expressions occur inadvertently in speech. These factors affect the listener experience, but removing them requires repetitive and time-consuming work. According to our user research, editing typically took 3-4 times longer than the original audio. With the help of speech recognition techniques, audio can be quickly recognized and batch-processed through text. There are several excellent text-audio editors, such as Descript and Spotify Soundtrap, but none support Chinese. Solution \u00b6 To use Audioc, you only need to follow the three steps: set up, edit and export. Set up Create a project. It is a folder to store relevant audio files and their copies. Import original audio files Transcribe the audio files Copy editable files from original files Edit Text Editor. After transcribing, the text will connect to audio at the word level. Users can manipulate the audio using text editor features, such as delete, cut, copy, and past. More importantly, we support finding and deleting all in one click to remove all filler words. Track Editor. Although the text editor can boost efficiency, it sometimes needs more precision. That\u2019s why we build the track editor similar to traditional DAW to provide more flexibility but only keep the necessary features for simplicity. Specifically, we have a select/cut switch, and take advantage of iPad gestures such as click, drag, magnification, and swipe. Plus, users can combine several tracks into a multi-track editor simply by dragging and dropping. Export Currently, we provide two ways to export audio: one is to export it as a local file, and the other is to share it with other Apps. The supported formats are m4a and mp3.
